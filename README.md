# PlasticPicker
An application that aims to shape the character of environmental awareness, specifically about the dangers of plastic to the environment, through games and routines that support the game

## Inspiration
As a person who has loved the ocean since I was a child, I was very worried about the increasingly polluted ocean by plastic waste. The level of plastic pollution has been at life-threatening levels and has poisoned the food chains of many marine animals. In the end this not only threatens the existence of life in the oceans but also endangers humans as the highest peak of the food chain. Therefore, I try to help global efforts in reminding the impact of plastic pollution on life by creating mobile applications. The goal is that awareness is increasingly widespread, especially among younger generations who are very gadget-minded and enjoy playing mobile games.

## What it does
This application entertains users with a mobile game and some real challenges as an integral part of the game. Both the game and the challenges aim to gradually form a user character who is aware of the dangers that threaten the environment caused by plastic pollution around the world.

## How I built it
Using Android with Android Studio on local machine and Firebase for online service.

## Challenges I ran into
Coding the Java native, doing "gradle" and integrating several resources in a very limited time as sometimes the compilation process took time quite long.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I finally can create something about things that I've been concerned over the years (environmental issues).

## What I learned
Time management in a "idea to production" process is always a critical thing.

## What's next for Plastic Picker
There will be more improvement like :
- More marine animals in the app library
- Level of game
- Rewarding system
- Visual aspect (design and animation)
- Interaction among users
- and many more
